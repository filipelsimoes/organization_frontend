Frontend project done with React

After cloning the project, dont forget to npm install to install the dependecies.
To start the project, npm start.

In the project you can find a SPA (single page application), using 4 endpoints (Provided in the backend project).

You can: 
  Get all organizations in a list
  Get all organizations by name or parent name (using backend)
  Upload a csv file and will show all the organizations of the csv file.
  
  Bonus: Create a new organization
  
  Bonus: Also created other search bar, to do a filter without the backend.
  
  First thing after npm start (and put backend running) should be load the csv file. This will import the information to the database.
  After that you can start using the search's bars.
